### 🤖 Automation Rules

1. **Auto-add to project**
   - When: Issue created with labels `001-adaptive-platform`, `002-ab-testing`, or `003-multivariate`
   - Action: Add to project

2. **Move to In Progress**
   - When: Issue assigned
   - Action: Move to "In Progress" column

3. **Move to Review**
   - When: Pull request linked
   - Action: Move to "In Review" column

4. **Move to Done**
   - When: Issue closed
   - Action: Move to "Done" column

5. **Flag as Blocked**
   - When: Label `blocked` added
   - Action: Move to "Blocked" column

### 📈 Metrics & Insights

**Velocity Chart**: Track story points completed per sprint
**Burndown Chart**: Monitor progress toward milestone completion
**Cycle Time**: Measure time from "To Do" to "Done"
**WIP Limits**: Set maximum items in "In Progress" (e.g., 5 per developer)

### 👥 Team Assignment

**Recommended Team Structure**:
- 2-3 developers per specification
- 1 tech lead overseeing all three specs
- Dedicated reviewers for cross-team PRs

**Assignment Strategy**:
- Assign [P] parallel tasks to different developers
- Group related sequential tasks to same developer
- Balance workload by story points

## Getting Started

1. **Create the GitHub Project**:
   ```bash
   # Go to: https://github.com/orgs/YOUR_ORG/projects/new
   # Or: https://github.com/users/YOUR_USERNAME/projects/new
   ```

2. **Import Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Run the issue creation script
   ./scripts/create-github-issues.sh
   ```

3. **Configure Project**:
   - Add custom fields as defined above
   - Set up the three views (Board, Table, Timeline)
   - Configure automation rules

4. **Bulk Add Issues**:
   - Filter repository issues by labels
   - Select all and add to project
   - Auto-categorize by milestone

5. **Set Up Integrations**:
   - Connect to Slack for notifications
   - Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD status
   - Configure branch protection rules

## Tracking Progress

### Weekly Metrics to Track
- Tasks completed vs planned
- Velocity trend
- Blocker count and age
- PR review time
- Test coverage change

### Daily Standup View
Filter: Status = "In Progress" OR Status = "Blocked"
Group By: Assignee
Sort: Priority (High to Low)

### Sprint Planning View
Filter: Milestone = Current Sprint AND Status = "To Do"
Sort: Dependencies, then Priority
