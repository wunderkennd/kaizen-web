# Feature Specification: KAIZEN Adaptive Platform Core

**Feature Branch**: `001-adaptive-platform`  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation  
**Priority**: Must Have (P0)
**Dependencies**: None

## Executive Summary

Core adaptive platform implementing dynamic UI generation based on user context, PCM stages, and real-time personalization. This is the foundational system that enables all other KAIZEN features.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a WKV platform user, I want the platform to dynamically adapt its interface to my expertise level, current context, and psychological stage (PCM), so that I can discover and engage with anime content more efficiently without experiencing choice fatigue.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new user with no anime viewing history, **When** they first access the platform, **Then** the system presents a simplified "Onboarding Mode" interface with gateway titles and guided discovery

2. **Given** an experienced anime fan at the Attachment PCM stage, **When** they access the platform, **Then** the system presents an "Aficionado Mode" with high-density information and advanced features

3. **Given** a user accessing from a mobile device during commute, **When** they have limited time, **Then** the system prioritizes short-form content and adjusts UI density

4. **Given** a user asking "Show me something cozy for a rainy day", **When** using conversational search, **Then** the AI Sommelier returns contextually appropriate recommendations

5. **Given** a designer using the Rule Management Interface, **When** they define conflicting adaptation rules, **Then** the system visualizes priority-based conflict resolution

### Edge Cases
- System loads static default interface when real-time adaptation fails
- Users can manually override adaptive behaviors and lock preferred interface mode
- Cold start users default to "Onboarding Mode" using generalized data
- System handles 5-10M concurrent users during peak simulcast releases
