# Feature Specification: A/B Testing Infrastructure

**Feature Branch**: `002-ab-testing`  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation  
**Priority**: Must Have (P0)
**Dependencies**: 001-adaptive-platform (core services)

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive A/B testing infrastructure enabling controlled experiments on UI variations, feature rollouts, and algorithmic changes. This system ensures statistical rigor while supporting the dynamic nature of the KAIZEN adaptive platform.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a product team member, I want to run controlled experiments on UI variations and features so that I can make data-driven decisions about platform improvements and measure their impact on user engagement and PCM progression.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a designer wants to test two hero banner designs, **When** they create an A/B test with 50/50 traffic split, **Then** users are consistently assigned to variants and results show statistical significance

2. **Given** an experiment is showing negative impact, **When** the system detects degraded metrics, **Then** automatic safeguards pause the experiment and alert the team

3. **Given** a user joins an experiment mid-flight, **When** they return to the platform, **Then** they see the same variant consistently across sessions

4. **Given** multiple overlapping experiments are running, **When** assignment occurs, **Then** the system prevents interaction effects through proper isolation

5. **Given** an experiment reaches statistical significance, **When** results are analyzed, **Then** confidence intervals and practical significance are clearly displayed

### Edge Cases
- Experiments with less than minimum sample size show warnings
- Users can be excluded from experiments based on profile attributes
- System handles graceful degradation when experiment service is unavailable
- Bot traffic is automatically filtered from experiment results

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Experiment Configuration & Management
