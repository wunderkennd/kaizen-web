# Feature Specification: Multivariate Experimentation Platform

**Feature Branch**: `003-multivariate-experiments`  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation  
**Priority**: Must Have (P0)
**Dependencies**: 001-adaptive-platform (core), 002-ab-testing (experiment infrastructure)

## Executive Summary

Advanced experimentation platform supporting multivariate testing, multi-armed bandits, and ML-driven optimization. This system enables complex experimental designs for the KAIZEN adaptive platform while maintaining statistical rigor and real-time optimization capabilities.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a data scientist or product manager, I want to run sophisticated experiments testing multiple variables simultaneously and use machine learning to optimize user experiences in real-time, so that I can discover optimal combinations and continuously improve platform performance.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a designer wants to test 3 button colors × 2 layouts × 2 copy variants, **When** they create a multivariate test, **Then** the system automatically generates 12 combinations and allocates traffic efficiently

2. **Given** a multi-armed bandit is optimizing content recommendations, **When** one arm consistently outperforms others, **Then** the system gradually shifts more traffic to the winning variant while maintaining exploration

3. **Given** a Bayesian optimization experiment is running, **When** new data arrives, **Then** the system updates posterior distributions and adjusts traffic allocation in real-time

4. **Given** social features are being tested, **When** network effects could bias results, **Then** the system uses cluster randomization to prevent spillover between treatment groups

5. **Given** an experiment has interaction effects between variables, **When** analyzing results, **Then** the system detects and reports significant interactions with appropriate statistical tests

### Edge Cases
- System handles factorial explosion by limiting variable combinations
- Cluster randomization prevents network effects in social features
- Early stopping rules prevent statistical inflation from continuous monitoring
- Cold start problem handled through prior knowledge incorporation
