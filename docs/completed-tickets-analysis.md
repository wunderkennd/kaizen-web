- **Action**: Close ticket #41

### T008: Initialize Rust project for streaming-adapter ‚úÖ
**Status**: PARTIALLY COMPLETED
**Evidence**:
- `/services/streaming-adapter/` exists
- Basic directory structure created
- Note: Has 3 duplicate tickets (#1, #18, #42)
- **Action**: Close all three duplicate tickets

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Tickets Marked "Done" But Still Open

Several tickets have the "done" label but are still open:
- T001-T008 all appear to be done based on file system evidence

## üö´ NOT Started (Confirmed)

### Infrastructure:
- T009: Docker Compose (no `docker-compose.yml` found)
- T010: Shared contracts (no `/packages/contracts/` directory)
- T011-T015: Database migrations (empty `/migrations/` directory)
- T069-T070: Kubernetes/Deployment (empty `/k8s/` directory)

### Testing:
- T016-T025: Contract tests (no test files found)
- T058-T062: Integration tests (no e2e test files found)

### CI/CD:
- T175-T182: GitHub Actions (empty `.github/workflows/` directory)

## üìä Summary Statistics

- **Total Tickets Created**: ~200
- **Actually Completed**: 8 tickets (T001-T008)
- **Completion Rate**: 4% 
- **Duplicate Issues**: T008 has 3 copies

## üéØ Recommended Actions

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Close completed tickets T001-T008** (8 tickets)
2. **Close duplicate T008 tickets** (#1, #18)
3. **Remove "done" label from uncompleted work**
4. **Update project board** to reflect actual status

### Priority Focus (Given Cloud Run Decision):
1. **Skip Kubernetes tickets** (T166, T177)
2. **Start with Cloud Run tickets** (T183-T190)
3. **Focus on Docker optimization** (T176)
4. **Implement basic CI/CD** (T175, T188)

## üîç Key Findings

### What Was Done:
- Basic project structure created
- All 7 microservices initialized
- Frontend Next.js app scaffolded
- Development environments set up

### What Wasn't Done:
- No actual implementation code
- No Docker configurations
- No CI/CD pipelines
- No database schemas
- No tests written
- No deployment configurations

### Time Assessment:
The completed work represents approximately **2-3 days** of initial setup work, which is typical for project initialization.

## üí° Recommendation

Given that only the basic setup is complete:
1. **Close the 8 completed tickets** to clean up the issue tracker
2. **Focus on Cloud Run migration** (T183-T190) instead of Kubernetes
3. **Prioritize Docker setup** (T176) and basic CI/CD (T175, T188)
4. **Start implementing actual service logic** after infrastructure is ready

The project is essentially at the "empty skeleton" stage - all the folders exist but no actual functionality has been implemented yet.
